#Here are following identifier naming convention for Python:
#   Class names start with an uppercase letter and all other identifiers with a lowercase letter.
#   Starting an identifier with a single leading underscore indicates by convention that the identifier is meant to be private.
#   Starting an identifier with two leading underscores indicates a strongly private identifier.
#   If the identifier also ends with two trailing underscores, the identifier is a language-defined special name.
