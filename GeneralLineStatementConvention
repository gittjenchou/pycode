#Statements in Python typically end with a new line. 
#Python does, however, allow the use of the line continuation character (\) to denote that the line should continue. For example:

total = item_one + \
        item_two + \
        item_three

#Statements contained within the [], {}, or () brackets do not need to use the line continuation character. For example:

days = ['Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday',
        'Thursday', 'Friday']



#Python accepts single ('), double (") and triple (''' or """) quotes to denote string literals, 
#as long as the same type of quote starts and ends the string.

#The triple quotes can be used to span the string across multiple lines. For example, all the following are legal:

word = 'word'
sentence = "This is a sentence."
paragraph = """This is a paragraph. It is
made up of multiple lines and sentences."""
