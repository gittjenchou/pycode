#Python has five standard data types:
#    Numbers
#    String
#    List
#    Tuple
#    Dictionary

#Python supports four different numerical types:
#    int (signed integers)
#    long (long integers [can also be represented in octal and hexadecimal])
#    float (floating point real values)
#    complex (complex numbers)

#Here are some examples of numbers:
#   int         long                        float           complex
#   10          51924361L                   0.0             3.14j
#   100         -0x19323L                   15.20           45.j
#   -786        0122L                       -21.9           9.322e-36j
#   080         0xDEFABCECBDAECBFBAEL       32.3+e18        .876j
#   -0490       535633629843L               -90.            -.6545+0J
#   -0x260      -052318172735L              -32.54e100      3e+26J
#   0x69        -4721885298529L             70.2-E12        4.53e-7j

#Lists are the most versatile of Python's compound data types. A list contains items separated by commas and enclosed within square brackets ([]).
#!/usr/bin/python

list = [ 'abcd', 786 , 2.23, 'john', 70.2 ]
tinylist = [123, 'john']

print list          # Prints complete list
print list[0]       # Prints first element of the list
print list[1:3]     # Prints elements starting from 2nd to 4th
print list[2:]      # Prints elements starting from 3rd element
print tinylist * 2  # Prints list two times
print list + tinylist # Prints concatenated lists


#A tuple is another sequence data type that is similar to the list. A tuple consists of a number of values separated by commas. Unlike lists, however, tuples are enclosed within parentheses.
#Tuples can be thought of as read-only lists.

tuple = ( 'abcd', 786 , 2.23, 'john', 70.2  )
tinytuple = (123, 'john')

print tuple           # Prints complete list
print tuple[0]        # Prints first element of the list
print tuple[1:3]      # Prints elements starting from 2nd to 4th
print tuple[2:]       # Prints elements starting from 3rd element
print tinytuple * 2   # Prints list two times
print tuple + tinytuple # Prints concatenated lists

#Python 's dictionaries are hash table type. They work like associative arrays or hashes found in Perl and consist of key-value pairs.

tinydict = {'name': 'john','code':6734, 'dept': 'sales'}
print dict['one']       # Prints value for 'one' key
print dict[2]           # Prints value for 2 key
print tinydict          # Prints complete dictionary
print tinydict.keys()   # Prints all the keys
print tinydict.values() # Prints all the values
